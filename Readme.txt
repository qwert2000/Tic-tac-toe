3)Code consists of two mains,first main is for tic-tac-toe and please enter number of rows and wining positions as 3.
4)The second main is for open tic-tak-toe problem where you can enter greater than 3.
5)Tic-tac-toe for 3*3 board all algorithms will run as fast as possible.
6)open tic-tac-toe for size greater than 3 the min-max and alpha-beta pruning will take 30 minutes of time.
7)The depth-limit and heuristic and depth-limit with alpha-beta pruning with size 4 will take around 10-30 seconds.
8)The depth-limit and heuristic and depth-limit with alpha-beta-pruning with size greater than 4 will take more than 25 minutes.
9)If you get struck in pygame windom then restart the kernal and run all.
